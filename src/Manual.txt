Gain Pitfall
Before relying on the tool, the user MUST compare the values with other providers like, google finance, or finance.yahoo.com
AlphaVantage.co ignores splits and reverse-splits, and provide nominal stock or ETF price. The tool tries to guess splits by looking into sharp falls, or sharp rise. The button <calc-splits>  allows to by pass these calculations.
The guessed splits column, can be shown by checkbox <splits_list<   Purple chart means splits discovered, and chart and gain value manipulated.
